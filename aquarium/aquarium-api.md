## Overview

The Aquarium API provides simple **RESTful HTTPS** to explore and interact with the Aquarium platform from your own applications.

**Note**: 

- HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and the server. 
- For this API the following HTTPS methods are use:
    - **GET** - read
    - **POST** - create
    - **DELETE** - delete

## Composing a Request

The API is a set of core methods and a standard request format. These are combined to form a URL that returns the information you want. Below are two examples of API calls: 

1. Here's an example of an API call that allows you to authenticate with the API(server): 

    ```
    https://aquarium.h2o.ai/api/login
    ```

    - **aquarium.h2o.ai** - the API host, in this case for the REST API
    - **api/login** - the method you're using, represented as a path

    **Note**: Most requests must be authenticated, and therefore, methods requiring authentication will be specified. For example, the above method requires request body parameters and such parameters are as follows: ReCaptcha, email, and password. Again, the methods requiring authentication will be specified while specifying how to achieve a successful authentication.

    To learn more about this method, please check this section of the API: [users](#users)

2. Here's an example of an API call that returns metrics about a particular Aquarium lab: 

    ```
    https://aquarium.h2o.ai/api/lab/{id}
    ```

    - **aquarium.h2o.ai** - the API host, in this case for the REST API 
    - **/api/lab/{id}** - the method you're using, represented as a path 
        - in this case, you will need to finish the method by specifying a particular lab ID: the lab ID will represent the lab metrics the server will return 

    **Note**: The above method is a clear example of a method requiring authentication, as mentioned in the first example above. Before this method can be executed, the **/api/login** method needs to be called first to authenticate with the API(server) and receive a JSESSIONID that will need to be pass to subsequent methods requiring authentication, similar to this method.  

    To learn more about this method, please check this section of the API: [labs and lab instances](#labs-and-lab-instances)

## JSON: Response

The current version of the API returns all responses as JSON unless otherwise specified. 

## Errors

When a successful API request is made, the API(server) will send a 200 response code along with your data. Otherwise, you will receive a response with error details formatted in either XML or JSON, keeping in mind the client's format (you) requested. Note, error responses will have one of the following HTTPS status codes: 

- **HTTP Error 401 (Unauthorized)**
    - The client needs to be authorized to access the specific path method. It usually occurs because of a failed login attempt.
- **HTTP Error 400 (Bad Request)**
    - A  message is alerting you that the application you are using (e.g., your web browser) accessed it incorrectly or that the request was somehow corrupted on the way.
- **HTTP Error 404 (Not Found)**
    - A 404 error happens when you try to access a resource on a web server (usually a web page) that doesnâ€™t exist. 
- **HTTP Error 403 (Forbidden)**
    - This error often occurs because no login opportunity was available. For example, when trying to access a forbidden directory on a website. 
- **HTTP Error 500 (Internal Server Error)**
    - This error occurs when an internal server error arises. For example, the server could be overloaded and therefore unable to process requests properly. 

## Aquarium Q&A

1\. **What is aquarium?**
- ```Aquarium is a service running in the cloud that lets people make themselves laboratory instances for temporary use.  Self-service is a primary goal.  Because of the pre-warming capability, it is good at managing large numbers of instances simultaneously for large live events.```

2\. **Where is aquarium running?**
- ```http://aquarium.h2o.ai```

3\. **Is aquarium open to the public?**
- ```Yes.```

4\. **When should I use aquarium?**
- ```Aquarium is intended for canned lab instances that have one-time use.  Aquarium is intended for use with canned data using a known tutorial script in a fixed window of time for learning or demonstration purposes.  A strength of aquarium is the Pre-Warm Batch capability that allows large groups (e.g. H2O World) to get lab instances instantly when managed properly.```

5\. **When should I not use aquarium?**
- ```If you want to experiment with your own data, aquarium is not the proper choice, because after the instance time expires the results vanish.  Gone.  Forever.  Ask about the puddle service instead if you don't want a ticking clock to terminate and permanently delete your experiments.  The ticking clock is essential for keeping costs under control and discouraging people from "abusing" it to get free EC2 time to run open ended experiments (vs. following a canned tutorial which people tend not to do over and over).```

6\. **How do I get an account?**
- ```Just go to the website and make yourself one.```

7\. **Do I still need a license key when running Driverless AI in aquarium?**
- ```Yes. Aquarium is BYOL(Bring Your Own License). Labs with a baked license will not require a license. ```

8\. **What happens to an aquarium instance after it ends?**
- ```It is terminated in Amazon EC2.  The instance is gone and the data (EBS storage) for the instance is gone.```

9\. **What are the different aquarium roles?**
- ```student/instructor/admin```

10\. **Where do aquarium instances actually run?**
- ```Amazon Web Services(AWS) EC2```

11\. **Can I run aquarium in Google Compute Cloud/Microsoft Azure Cloud/Other random place?**
- ```No, not today.  But it's just code.```

12\. **How can I run an aquarium instance for more than 60 minutes?**
- ```The easiest way is to start you instances and then extend them.  Users with the instructor role can extend running lab instances.```

13\. **Why does it take so long for my lab instance to start?  Can I do anything about that?**
- ```Aquarium just launches a new EC2 instance and waits for it to become ready.  So it takes as long as it takes.  But what you can do is use the Pre-Warm Batch capability to pre-start instances for real-time hands-on settings.```

14\. **Why does it take so long for my lab instance to start?  Can I do anything about that?**

- ```Aquarium just launches a new EC2 instance and waits for it to become ready.  So it takes as long as it takes.  But what you can do is use the Pre-Warm Batch capability to pre-start instances for real-time hands-on settings.```

15\. **What is the most number of simultaneous aquarium users that has been attempted so far?**
- ```Around 500 in H2O World SF 2019.```

16\. **What kind of things can aquarium run?**
- ```Aquarium uses CloudFormation templates to start AMIs.  So it doesn't really care what's in the AMI.  It's set up to run both DAI and Open Source labs today.```

17\. **How much does aquarium cost H2O.ai?**
- ```There is a small overhead cost, but the vast majority of the spend is lab instance EC2 time.  For the p2.xlarge and m4.4xlarge instances, a rough estimate is $1/lab hr (billed at fine-grained intervals of one minute or less by AWS).```

18\. **Is aquarium secure?**
- ```Aquarium stores SALTed passwords in its database, not actual passwords.  In that sense, it is secure. But its main goal is to get people to successfully run labs, and any kind of real security is contrary to that goal. Up to now, HTTPS is now enforced by Nginx; therefore,  in that configuration, it's secure.```

19\. **Where is the aquarium code?**
- ```http://github.com/h2oai/aquarium```

20\. **Is aquarium open source?**
- ```The repo isn't open today, but there is no reason it couldn't be.```

21\. **Can I give a customer their own instance of aquarium?**
- ```Setting up a brand-new Aquarium is relatively straightforward.  I don't see any reason we couldn't give it to a customer.  Most people will just want the convenience of using our H2O.ai hosted aquarium, though.```
